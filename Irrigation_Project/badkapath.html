                <h4>
                    1) Introduction and Description of the Project

                </h4>
                <p>The Badkapath Irrigation Project (Badkapath Irrigation Project) area is located in left bank of Rapti
                    River covering most of the cultivable area of three VDCs namely Gobardiha, Gangaparaspur and Gadhawa
                    ie ward No 1-7 of Gadhwa Rural Municipality. Presently, the farmers use local streams to irrigate
                    their land during monsoon season. The streams carry no water during winter season and farmers have
                    to depend on rainy water for irrigating their lands. There are no appropriate intake structures for
                    regulating water into the canals, especially during flood period. Due to the temporary nature of the
                    system, the farmers have to face awful difficult situation after every flood event damaging all
                    their efforts of successfully diverting the river water. Numbers of secondary and sub secondary
                    systems off take from local streams by constructing diversion structures made up of local earth and
                    forest product. The technical and other resources capabilities for operation and maintenance are
                    thus beyond the capability of the local farmers.</p>



                <p>After successful implementation and operation of Praganna Kulo Irrigation Project which irrigate 5800
                    Ha cultivable area of Chaulahi, Sonpur, Sisahaniya & Lalmatiya VDCs of Dang District, Department of
                    water Resource and Irrigation (DoWRI) through Badkapath Irrigation System aims to bring water from
                    West Rapti River by constructing new canal and required structures. It also aims to rehabilitate and
                    improve the existing irrigation systems in order to enhance the irrigation facility and convert them
                    into improved and effective irrigation systems. This proposed improvement includes construction of
                    intake at Rapti River, main canal, related structures and rehabilitation of existing FMISs by
                    integrating them into limited numbers of systems, river training works, institutional development of
                    Water User's Association and adequate agricultural support. The intake is located on the left bank
                    of Rapti river at about 1.1 km upstream from the location of MRM bridge at Bhalubang. The intake
                    area and initial 3 Km part of canal lies in ward no 6 of Jaluke VDC, ie ward no 1 of Sitganga
                    municipality of Arghakhachi district.</p>

                    2) Location and Access

                </h4>
                <p>The Project area is located in left bank of Rapti river in Deukhuri valley covering all the wards of
                    three VDCs namely Gobardiha, Gangaparaspur and Gadhawa of Dang district and ward No 6 of Jaluke VDC
                    of Arghakhanchi district. As an update, these VDCs are part of ward No 1 to 7 of Gadhawa Rural
                    Municipality. Govardiha VDC lies in ward No 1 to 3, Gangaparaspur lies in ward No 4,5 and Gadhawa
                    lies in ward No 6,7 of Gadhawa Rural Municipality and Jaluke -6 lies in Ward No 1 of Sitganga
                    Municipality of Arghakhanchi district. The intake is proposed on the left bank at about 1.1 km
                    upstream (Rapti river) of the MRM bridge at Bhalubang. The intake and part of canal lies in Lape
                    village, ward no 6 of Jaluke VDC, Arghakhachi district. In the eastern side, the area can be
                    accessed from the gravel road which offtakes from Mahendra Rajmarg at Kalakate which is about 2 Km
                    east of the bridge at Bhalubang. The gravel road passes almost midway longitudinally in east west
                    direction through the command area and rejoins the MRM at Lamahi by recrossing the Rapti river at
                    Balarampur. Thus, the Project area can be accessed in all season from the eastern side via Kalkate
                    and from the western side via Lamahi. Also, the traditional route to the Indian border at Koilabas,
                    passes through Gadhawa bazaar which lies in the western end of the command area. The 30 km
                    mountainous road is presently not motorable but plan for its upgradation to make it motorable has
                    been initiated by other concerned agency. Location, Command Area and VDCs is shown in following

                    3) Objectives

                </h4>
                <p>The objectives of Badkapath Irrigation Project are categorized into following headings:</p>


                <h5 id="para">Objective I: Irrigation Facility to Support Agricultural Production and Productivity </h5>

                <p>The direct objective of Badkapath Irrigation Project is to provide controlled diversion of water from
                    Rapti river and appropriate canal system to convey it to the agricultural fields so as to provide
                    year round assured irrigation to the 4000 ha agricultural land area most of which, presently depend
                    upon monsoon rain. Such assured irrigation will result in increase in agricultural production and
                    productivity of the area thereby providing support to the ultimate aim to uplift the socio-economic
                    condition of the people in the project area.</p>

                <h5 class="para">Objective II: Integrated Crop Water Management</h5>

                <p>Presently there is focus on Integrated Crop Water Management to facilitate optimum use of resources
                    to increase products and productivity. The Department of Water Resource and Irrigation is working in
                    close coordination and cooperation with Department of Agriculture. Implementation of Badkapath
                    Irrigation Project is expected to support Government's Integrated Crop Water Management targets.</p>

                <h4>
                    4) Existing Socio-Economic Situation

                </h4>



                <h5 id="para">4.1 Population</h5>

                <p>Total Population of the project area comprising people of ward No 1-7 of Gadhawa Rural Municipality
                    is about 33370.The population comprises of a mixture of communities; dominant being the indigenous
                    Tharu community which comprise 49% of the population. Dalit community form 7.80 percent of the
                    population in three VDCs (7.39 percent in Gadhwa 5.13% in Gangaparaspur and 10.04 percent in
                    Gobardiya.). Other indigenous community are the Kumal and Yadav. Most of the Bhramins,Chhetris and
                    other community of mountain origin have migrated from the hilly area of Rapti Zone. Most of the
                    people are engaged in agriculture. Those who earn from agriculture is categorized to land owner,
                    tenant and farm labor. Women are mostly engaged in agricultural labor.</p>

                <p>.</p>


                <h5 class="para">4.2 Food Sufficiency</h5>

                <p>Baseline study of the project area shows that regarding food security status 65.64% of the HH are
                    food insecure whereas 34.36% of the household (HH) are food secure for the whole year. The period of
                    the food unsecured is nearly 7.06 months of a year. Though the HHs have responded food secure it
                    does not indicate that are they really secured in terms of adequacy of Calories required.</p>


                <h5>4.3 Land, Land Tenure System And Irrigated Land Holding:</h5>

                <p>The average farm size in the system is about 0.70 Ha. The largest is in Gangaparaspur (0.87Ha.) and
                    lowest is in Gobardiha (0.63Ha.) from this farm in the proposed BplP the share is about 82.43%. The
                    upland land is about 47.54% and low land area is about 52.46%. The leased in area in the average
                    farm in project area is about 0.18 Ha. Socio economic situation seems to have been highly influenced
                    by construction of East West Highway. Before the EW Highway, the Gadhawa area was commercially
                    active because it lies in the route to the access road to India via Koilabas. The road has been
                    nonfunctional after the operation of EW highway which has resulted into downfall of the commercial
                    position of Gadhawa area. Presently efforts are ongoing to reopen the road. This is expected to
                    result in positive commercial opportunity by availing Illarket access to India.</p>

                    5) Water Resource Existing Water Use And Water Right

                </h4>


                <p>Water of West Rapti river in Deukhuri valley has been traditionally used by farmers living on both
                    side of the banks. After implementation of Praganna Kulo Irrigation Project the land on the right
                    bank is receiving assured year round water in a controlled manner through control structures
                    constructed by the project. In the left bank, an irrigation system was in existence in which water
                    was diverted from West Rapti river (from a point about 6 Km downstream from proposed location of
                    Badkapath Irrigation Project) by local brushwood, but overtime the intake as well part of canal at
                    various location has been eroded and washed away by Rapti river making it totally defunct. In some
                    area within the proposed project area the farmers tap flash flood water in the local drains and feed
                    it to irrigation ponds for irrigation use at later time but such method is not reliable and area
                    covered is limited. Towards the western tail end of the command area, there is in existence a
                    irrigation system namely the Dangalichhap kulo covering about 700 ha. A temporary brush wood and
                    boulder filled gabion is used to divert water from one braided channel of Rapti river. An intricate
                    canal system built traditionally conveys water to the fertile agricultural land covering about 700
                    ha. The intake is washed away in every flood and the farmers face difficulty to repair and maintain
                    it. Moreover, the river being of braided regime, the stability of channel is not certain. Therefore
                    the farmers of the Dangalichhap system area have also joined other farmers to request for the
                    Badkapath Irrigation Project. During monsoon the water available is much more than required. Only
                    for few days during dry month the water may not be sufficient. To handle such situation the farmers
                    living in opposite banks have traditionally established water sharing arrangement based on
                    proportional sharing of available water. Thus, regarding issue of water rights, it is observed that
                    there is harmony among the farmers of PKIP who are already using the water and farmers of Badkapath
                    Irrigation Project. Regarding to sharing water of Rapti River an mutual agreement has been made
                    between farmer representatives of both systems.</p>

                <h4>
                    6) Major Project Components

                </h4>



                <h5 id="para">6.1 Intake</h5>

                <p>A side intake with capacity of about 9m3/s is already  built on the left bank at about 1100 m</p>
                <p>upstream from the MRM bridge over Rapti river at Bhalubang. This is a side intake having capacity to  extract design canal discharge during the year round. The intake is well protected at upstream and downstream which have a separate access road built to reach upon even in monsoon season.</p>

                <p>.</p>


                <h5 class="para">6.2 Canal Alignment And Command Area</h5>

                <p>Soon after the intake, the canal alignment follows contour with a slope of about 1 : 3500. Canal alignment passes through the toe of forest area and to avoid agricultural land as far as technically possible. However in some places like Malmala village, the canal alignment goes through the command area. Total length of main canal is about 30 Km,the end will outfall at Kabri river, west of Gadhwa. Command area of the Project is 4000 Ha covering agricultural land highly suitable for irrigated agriculture. It is elongated in shape from east to west with width ranging from 0.5 Km to 4 Km. The area begins from the northern foothill of the churia mountains and extends upto the left bankline of Rapti river.</p>
                <p>.</p>


                <h5>6.3 Cross Drainage Works And Canal Infrastructure</h5>

                <p>The canal has to cross cut numerous cross drainage works which is by far the most technically challenging aspect of Badkapath Irrigation Project. Altogether there are 44 drainages of which major are 12 (length more than 100 m). Most of them a cut and cover canal system (superpassage) would be suitable. The command area is uniformly sloped towards north west so command area  development is expected to be relatively simple. Few dividing structures, canal road crossing structures, aqueducts and fall structures would be required. Road crosses are also major structures in this system. The Main canal alignment crosses   Mahendra Highway at one place near Bhalubang, Damodar Marga at One place near Badahara and Lamahi Koilabas road at Samaithan.</p>

                <h5>6.4 Command Area Protection Works</h5>

                <p>The canal has to cross cut numerous cross drainage works which is by far the most technically challenging aspect of Badkapath Irrigation Project. Altogether there are 44 drainages of which major are 12 (length more than 100 m). Most of them a cut and cover canal system (superpassage) would be suitable. The command area is uniformly sloped towards north west so command area  development is expected to be relatively simple.
